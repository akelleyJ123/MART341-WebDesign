I think I am most pround of the visual heirarchy through the use of contrast on my page. All of my headings use a tan color that stands out
against the darker tan background. The color work well together and make the difference between headings and paragraphs very clear. 

Though the black text of paragraphs doesn't stand out too much from the background, it stands out enough to not only be readable, but also clearly different from the headings. Overall, I think my use 
of contrast to display visual heirarchy is what I am most pround of.
