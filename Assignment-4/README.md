**How do browsers function?**

Web browsers work by sending a request to a server and recieving files in return. The browser interprets these files using different engines that allow the browser to interpret the files and display them for the user. The rendering engine is the engine that actually displays the visuals for the user through the interpretation of HTML and CSS documents. The browser engine controls the flow of traffic between the browser, rendering engine, and external servers. The browser also uses the network to send and recieve information to a server. The last engine used is the Javastript interpreter. It allows the browser to understand Javascript which is used to add interactivity to a site. Browsers also use cookies and local storage to remember information about a user. Things such as logins so that the user doesn't have to type their password every time they want to access the site. 

**What is the DOM?**

The DOM determines how a document is changed and accessed by representing documents as nodes. This allows Javascript to modify the content by relating objects in the page to styles which allow you to change the look and interactivity of your page. 

**HTML,XML,and XHTML**

HTML(Hypertext markup language) is the structure of a webpage. It determines where objects go and how they are setup. It also allows other files such as stylesheets to be embedded.

XML(Extensible markup language) is a markup language like HTML, but it describes information rather than displaying it like HTML. XML is used to transport data between different systems rather than used to display something on a webpage.

XHTML(Extensible hypertext markup language) is a combination of the two previous languages. It looks very similar to HTML, but has stricter rules when it comes to writing it. Browsers can often correct small mistakes in HTML code with litte issue, but less powerful devices such as mobile devices don't have the power for that. XHTML comes into play when writing code for something like a mobile device because it doesn't allow for any mistakes that a computer would correct in HTML.

**4 essential elements of HTML:**

- Document type (tells the browser the document is HTML)
- Root (Everything on your webpage goes inside this)
- Head (Used for document metadata or links to other files)
- Body (Everything the user is going to see)

**Purpose of index.html**

The index.html file is the homepage of your website. It is the file that the browser will always display first sort of like a README. It should always be placed in the root directory.

**Best naming practices**

When naming files you shouldn't use anything other than letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores. You should avoid starting file names with numbers, and keep your capital/lowercase letters consistant because the web is case sensitive. Use something like *camelCase* to keep your naming consistant.
