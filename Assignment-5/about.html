        <h1>Why I chose these ideas</h1>
        <hr />
        <h3>Music Festival Website</h3>
        <p>I love music and I think it would be cool to design a website for a music festival</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Coffee Shop</h3>
        <p>I like cozy, small town coffee shops and it would be fun to make a website for one</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Portfolio</h3>
        <p>Portfolios are important for finding work as a designer or developer and I'm not super happy with the one I have, so I want to make a new one</p>
