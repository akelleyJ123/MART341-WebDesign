        <h1>Website Ideas</h1>
        <hr />
        <h3>Music Festival Website</h3>
        <p>The first idea I have is for a music festival website. The website would include things like the lineup, set times, and a place to get tickets.<br />
        I'm leaning towards a country music festival, so the theme of the site would be rustic.</p>

        <h3>Local Coffee Shop Website</h3>
        <p>The next idea I have is for a local coffee shop website. It would be fairly simple, but feature their hours, a menu, a way to contact them, etc. <br />
        Since it's for a local coffee shop, if we are pretending that it's in Missoula, the website would be trendy and modern, but still feel like a small town shop.</p>

        <h3>Portfolio</h3>
        <p>My last idea is probably the most funtional and the most likely for me to actually build, which is a Portfolio. The website would feature my artwork, designs, and eventually showcase some of my future websites.
            <br />
            I would probably go with something simple, but eye catching and unique.</p>
