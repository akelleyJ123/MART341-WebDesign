## Local Coffee Shop

I have decided to make the coffee shop idea from last week. I want to develop this idea further because I think it would be the most fun to design and it fits the style idea I have the best. 

Last week I had the style of the website as something trendy and modern, but instead, I am going to make it rustic and cozy.  I want it to feel like a cozy, small town coffee shop instead of something you might find in seattle. 

## Reflection

I used various techniques such as bg color, text size/alignment, and line breaks to create balance within the site. The bg makes the site more readable and welcoming to look at by darkening and warming the color of the page. It also compliments the colors within images on the page to create balance. Text alignment and size creates hierarchy within the page, increasing readability and flow through the page. Line breaks/ horizontal rules also create hierarchy by seperating certain elements to increase readability.

The design of the site didn't differ too much from my inital idea. I wanted a rustic feel to the site and I feel like I accomplished that. There is a lot more that I want to do with the site, but it is a good start. I didn't run into too many issues. The only thing I had to look-up was how to align images, but it was very simple once I figured it out.
