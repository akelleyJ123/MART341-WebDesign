                Step 1: <i>Setting Up</i>
            </h2>
            <p>
                Before we get started, we will want to set up our work station.<br>
                So, to get started, we will want to put our mandrel in the lathe and put your ring blank on the mandrel.<br>
                You can tighten the blank on the mandrel using the alan wrench that should have come with the mandrel.<br>
                Make sure everything else is close, especially your crushed stone and choice of adhesive. 
                <br/>

            <h2 style="color: #cbdaff; font-size: 25px;">
                Step 2: <i>Adding Stones</i>
            </h2>
            <p>
                Though you can use either CA glue or UV Resin here, I suggest using CA glue for <br>
                this step because it sets quick, allowing you to more quickly add stones without worrying about glue dripping.<br>
                To start adding stones, drop a little bit of CA or resin into the channel on the blank and use the tweezers to place stones in the glue. <br>
                I suggest trying to use stones that don't stick up above the channel as much as possible, as it makes for less sanding later.<br>
                After covering a side with stones, spray a little bit of activator over the stones, (or place in sun if using UV Resin).<br>
                This will quickly set the glue and allow you to turn the blank without stones falling out. When completing this step,<br>
                you will want to use as little glue as possible while still holding the stones in place. Also, try to have as few gaps between stones as possible.<br>
                You can fill these in using smaller stones or some sort of stone powder. Glow powder can look really cool as well.
            </p>

            <h2 style="color: #cbdaff; font-size: 25px;">
                Step 3: <i>Sanding</i>
            </h2>
            <p>
                To start, you will want to wear some sort of dust mask for this step. You don't want to be breathing stone dust.<br>
                If you are using a very hard stone like Malachite, I would suggest using a dremel to sand down the stone as close to the top of the channel<br>
                as possible without touching the blank. For softer stones such as Turquoise, a medium grit sandpaper is will work great. Whether using<br>
                a dremel or sandpaper, especially with the lower grits, be careful about accidentally sanding the blanks. Depending on the material of the blank,<br>
                wood or bone especially, sanding the blank will damage it. You don't have to worry as much if you are using something like steel or ceramic.<br>
                To start sanding with the sandpaper, you will want to cut the sheets into long strips, and starting with the lower grits, dip the strip in water<br>
                before sanding. This helps control dust and protect the stone. Going from the lower grit(~120) to the medium grits(~600), turn the lathe on and sand the stone down<br>
                until it is right at the edge of the channel. 
            </p>

            <h2 style="color: #cbdaff; font-size: 25px;">
                Step 4: <i>Polishing</i>
            </h2>
            <P>
                Once the stone is even with the top of the channel, you will begin Polishing the stone with the higher grit sandpaper.<br>
                Just like you did with the lower grits, you will want to get the strips wet to protect the stone and help polish it. <br>
                Repeat what you did in the last step, just with your 2-3 highest grit sandpapers. Once the stone is sufficiently polished,<br>
                wipe of any dust or water from the surface and move on to the next step.
            </P>
            <h2 style="color: #cbdaff; font-size: 25px;">
                Step 5: <i>Sealing</i>
            </h2>
            <p>
                You can use UV Resin or CA Glue for this step, but I recommend using the resin. Resin dries clearer, drips less, and is much more durable over time.<br>
                No matter which one you use, you will want to make sure the lathe is off and will slowly squeeze out a little bit of resin over the stone while turning the lathe manually.<br>
                It is important that you cover not only the stone, but also the entire outside of the ring, edges and all. Be careful with using too much though.<br>
                You don't want it to pool anywhere.

                Step 6: <i>Cleanup</i>
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you did the last step correctly, the ring should be all done, but sealing the ring correctly takes a lot of practice, and is still somehting I struggle with.<br>
                When using CA glue especially, it is easy to get bubbles or pooling that you may need to file off with sandpaper or a metal file which is why resin is so nice.<br>
                Resin doesn't bubble nearly as much, and is thicker than CA glue so it doesn't pool as easily.
            </p>
            <h2 style="color: #cbdaff; font-size: 25px;">
                Step 7: <i>You're done!</i>
            </h2>
            <p>
                Great job on making a stone inlay ring. You first ring may not be perfect, but with more practice, the techniques presented here will become second nature and<br>
                you will be creating beautiful inlay rings in no time.
