3+ Pages – The website should contain multiple pages with a cohesive theme.
 - **Website includes home, menu, and about pages**

Framework Integration – Incorporate a CSS framework of your choice (e.g., Bootstrap, Foundation) to enhance design and layout.
 - **Integrated boostrap to enhance website design/layout**

Framework Styling Elements – Use predefined styling components from the chosen framework for consistency and visual appeal.
 - **Used bootstrap to create a navigation bar at the top of the site**
 - **Styled the navigation bar using bootstrap colors**

HTML5 Canvas – Include an HTML5 canvas element to display custom graphics or animations.
 - **Used HTML canvas to create a horizontal rule at the top of the about page. The only issue with this is that I wasn't able to get stroke style to work so I was unable to change the color of the stroke, keeping the stroke black, which didn't work very well on the dark background color of the page.**

JavaScript Functionality – Add JavaScript to enhance interactivity or perform dynamic actions on the site.
