Three or more pages.
 - **Created a home/hours page, a menu page, a contact page, and an about-us page**

A clear, well-organized layout with strong usability.
- **Utilized Bootstrap to create a clean layout**
- **I tried to make this site screen reactive but couldn't make it work in a way that looked good. If I really wanted to make the site reacitive I wouldn't have used a background image because that was the biggest issue I had with reactivity. If the site was for a paying client, I would have started with mobile first design, and either not used the image at all or utilized it in a different way.**

- **Used an external style sheet to style pages and a fonts style sheet to import and apply fonts across pages**

Apply at least one font.

At least one image (preferably your own or fair-use images).
- **Used a fair use image as the background for all pages except for contact**

At least one embedded media element (video, audio, Google Maps, etc.).
- **Embedded a custom map into the contact page**

Structural and semantic HTML markup with a clean and organized page layout.
- **HTML is well structured within div and span tags**

Legible, well-commented, and error-free code.
